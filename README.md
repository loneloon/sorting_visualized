# Sorting Algos Visualized

## Description
  This repo includes a few basic sorting alorithms written in Python:
    *Bubble sort
    *Insertion sort
    *Merge sort
    *Heap sort
    *BTS (Binary Tree Sort)
    
  The following algos have an implemented visualizer^
    *Bubble sort
    *Insertion sort
    *Heap Sort
   
  Upon running sorting algos with visualizer you will be asked if visuals should be enabled.
  If you choose to use it you will be prompted for your display resolution specs.
  Visuals will be run in fullscreen by default. You can alter that in Visualizer class, 
  which is located in visualizer.py, if needed, by setting Fullscreen attr to False in __init__.
